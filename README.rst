Epytope is a framework for T-cell epitope detection, and vaccine design. It  offers consistent, easy, and simultaneous access to well established prediction methods of computational immunology. Epytope can handle polymorphic proteins and offers analysis tools to select, assemble, and design linker sequences for string-of-beads epitope-based vaccines. It is implemented in Python in a modular way and can easily be extended by user defined methods.
